# How to run this app?

## Requirements

  - Ensure the folder `build` is at the same place the binaries are located.

  - Only x64 architectures are supported.

  - Port :8080 must be available when running the app.

  - If you don't want to run the pre-compiled binaries, you'll need a recent
  version of Golang + Node.js. Build each individual package and place their
  output here, i.e. the `build` folder of ReactJS (generated by `yarn build`)
  and the executable compiled from Golang.

## After Compiling

Just run the executable and go to `http://localhost:8080`
